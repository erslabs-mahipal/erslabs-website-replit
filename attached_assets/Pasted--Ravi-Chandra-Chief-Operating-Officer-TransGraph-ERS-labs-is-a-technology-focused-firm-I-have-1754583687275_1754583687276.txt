ERS labs is a technology-focused firm. I have engaged them to develop new modules and a solution that was needed to deploy at the client's place. I have had very positive experiences with the firm and founding team. The vast experience of the ERS Lab's in developing product platforms such as Appnip is an immense advantage. Their quest of diagnosing the problem and pain point stands at the industry's best approach. Wish them good luck.
